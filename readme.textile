h1. CI Growl Library

This is a simple library for sending Growl notifications via a CodeIgniter application.


h2. Credits

Original code comes from "netgrowl.php":http://the.taoofmac.com/space/projects/netgrowl.php from "Rui Carmo":http://the.taoofmac.com/space/HomePage. It was ported into a CodeIgniter library by "Erik Reagan":http://twitter.com/erikreagan

On the way...once I commit the library itself.
